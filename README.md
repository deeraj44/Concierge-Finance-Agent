# Concierge-Finance-Agent
# 🚀 Overview
The **Concierge Finance Agent** acts as your personal CFO. Instead of standard chatbots that guess numbers, this agent uses the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) to execute Python code for precise financial tracking, while using Gemini 1.5 Flash to provide empathetic, actionable advice.

# ✨ Key Features
- Affordability Checks: Ask "Can I afford X?" and get an answer based on your real remaining budget.
- Zero-Hallucination Math: Uses deterministic Python tools for all calculations.
- Auto-Categorization: Intelligently groups raw transaction logs (e.g., "UBER" $\to$ Transport).

# 💬 Example Usage
